## tried and failed to get this to display my timeblocks and will be working
## with my tutor on Tuesday to help me get on the right track.

This is meant to be a program which displays work hour blocks, which can hold
scheduled appointments in local storage, and persist when the page is refreshed.

So far, the only thing i've gotten to work is displaying the current date at the top of the
screen. I don't know why, but I was able to make it work with DayJS() and not Moment()
