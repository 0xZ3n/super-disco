## Still needs to implement, local storage, but all is closer to being complete
## I receieved clarification from my tutor on several mistakes I was making on my first submission of this. 

This is meant to be a program which displays work hour blocks, which can hold
scheduled appointments in local storage, and persist when the page is refreshes. 
I tried implementing with DayJS, as Moment is deprecated, and I couldn't get it to display what I wanted
but my tutor helped me figure that what my mistakes were there.
